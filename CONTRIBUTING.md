# Contributing to Terminal Music Player

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Below are some simple guidelines to help get your contributions merged quickly.

- Fork the repository and create a branch for your change: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
- Write clear, focused commits and a descriptive PR title.
- If you add or change behavior, update or add tests when possible.
- Keep code style consistent; run linters/formatters if available.
- Open a pull request describing the change, why it's needed, and any background.

Reporting bugs:
- Open an issue with steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment (OS, Python version).

Feature requests:
- Open an issue describing the use case and suggested behavior. Small, incremental PRs are easier to review.
